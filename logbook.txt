BASIC CONFIGURATION OF THE YML FILE OF A DOCKER CONTAINR OF POSTGRESQL:
  https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres => HERE IT IS A BASIC GUIDE TO SETUP A POSTGRESQL YAML FILE

BASIC INTERACTION WITH DOCKER CONTAINER:
  docker-compose up -d [SERVICE_NAME]  ===> TURNS ON A SERVICE OF THE docer-compose.yml file
  docker-compose down [SERVICE_NAME] ===> TURNS OF A SERVICE IN OF THE docker-compose.yml file
  docker-compose ps ===> PRINTS OUT THE CURRENT RUNNING DOCKER'S SERVICES STATUS

HOW TO ACCESS A POSTGRESQL DOCKER CONTAINER IN BASH MODE:
  docker-compose exec [SERVICE_NAME] bash ===> ENTERS INTO A RUNING DOCKER SERVICE IN BASH MODE, IT CAN BE USED TO ACCES A POSTGRESS CONTAINER
  psql -h localhost -d [DB_NAME(my_store)] -U user ===> When you're in the container you can acces to a created db using this command
  \d+  ===> When youre in the db you can see it's schema using this command

CONFIGURE A PGADMIN4 IMAGE TO ACCES A POSTGRESQL DOCKER CONTAINER BY A WEB GRAPHIC UI:
  https://hub.docker.com/r/dpage/pgadmin4
  IF YOU WANT TO CONNECT THE DB INSIDE THE DOCKER CONTAINER WITH PGADMIN4 UI YOU MAY WANT TO KNOWS IT'S IP

  HOW TO KNOW THE IP OF A POSTGRESQL DOCKER CONTAINER:
    YOU CAN:
      - Enter into the container with docker-compose exec [SERVICE_NAME] bash THEN JUST grab the id from the dir location of the basmode
      OR
      - docker ps ===> WILL GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE COINTAINERS, THE ONE YOU NEED IT'S THE ID OF THE POSTGRESQL CONTAINER
          ===> docker inspect [CONTAINER_ID(81384ff38429)] ===> PRINTS OUT A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE GIVEN CONTAINER, YOU MUST LOOK UP FOR THE 'IPAddress' PROP AT THE END.
